## **Key Questions:**
1. Are certain game genres more popular than others?
2. Who are the main competitors in specific markets?
3. How have game popularity and sales varied over time?
4. What are the sales trends across different geographic regions?

## **Data Analysis Tasks**
  * Data cleaning, wrangling and consistency checks
  * Conduct exploratory data analysis
  * Grouping and summarising data
  * Conduct a descriptive analysis
  * Develop insights and create visualisations
  * Produce a presentation communicating insights

## **Target Audience:**
  GameCo executives, including the Vice President of Marketing, Chief Financial Officer, and Senior Vice President of Sales, seek insights into genre performance, competitor analysis, and market trends to make informed decisions.

## **Data**
The dataset covers historical video game sales (units sold in millions) from 1980 to 2016, sourced from VGChartz. It encompasses various platforms, genres, and publishing studios, focusing on games that sold more than 10,000 copies.
